<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there, and welcome to my cruddy about me page! I'm a newbie web developer starting today, there is not much 
  to say about myself considering I don't have a good set of skills. I have a but a humble background and just a poor 
  student that's making up for it with hard work and dedication!
</p>

<p>I am J.C. I won't say my full name for privacy reasons, but I'll just use my github nickname, BlankRune or just call me Blanky. 
  Turned 22 last year(2025), and of course still just a student for this year and the remaining college years I have.
</p>

<p>Nothing much to say now since I'm out of words, but thank you for checking my simple webpage project activity from school!</p>
